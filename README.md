# rPHYLOTA

*This package has not been recently updated! rPHYLOTA was originally developed for scrapping data from phylota and performing further analyses based on the resulting dataset. Phylota's website was recently updated to http://sirloinpope.com/. Several functions needs to be fixed based on the new structure of the website*

*Other alternatives are readily available out there*
